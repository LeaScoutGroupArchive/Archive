			<h1>About us</h1>
			<p>Every week, the Scouts help almost half a million people aged 4-25 develop skills for life.</p>
			<p>Lea Scout Group helps develop skills for life for those aged between 6 and 14.</p>
			<h3>Although we were registered with The Scout Association in 2003 Lea Scout Group has a history dating back to 1937 through almagamation with other groups.</h3><br>
			<p>In 1937 the 22nd Beds (21st Luton) were registered with the Scout Association. They were also known as 6th Chiltern or the Luton Air Scouts. They met at the methodist church on Marsh road. Their neckerchief was initially sky blue but changed to dark blue with a sky blue border.</p><br>
			<p>In 1945 the 96th Beds (17th Luton) were registered with the Scout Association. Their name changed to 2nd Chiltern. They initially met on Oakley road but moved to our current headquarters on Bodmin road. Their neckerchief initially was green with grey halves but changed to be green with yellow border and a badge.</p><br>
			<p>In 1955 the 95th Beds (39th Luton) were registered with the Scout Association. They met at Beechwood Road School. They initially had a green neckerchief with a white patch and moved to a green neckerchief with yellow border. This group almagamated with 96th Beds in 1966.</p><br>
			<p>In 2003 Luton Air Scouts and 2nd Chiltern amalgamated to form Lea Scout Group, we still meet on what was the former 2nd Chiltern Scout hut on Bodmin road. Our neckerchief is blue with a yellow border. There are many references to our group heritage around our headquarters that can be seen on the Artwork page.</p>
