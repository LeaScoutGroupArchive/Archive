		<h2>Scouting for boys</h2>
		<p>Scouting for boys was the official handbook of the boy scouts, written by Baden Powell following the first 'Scout' camp on Brownsea Island. It contains an early version of the Scout promise and law and outlines a scout's duty. Although these have changed over time it is still clear that we follow along almost the same promise and law today!</p>
		<br>
		<p>You can see that our book has unfortunately fallen into a state of disrepair, it does however contain all of the pages. The book also features annotations from its prior owners, to which it appears there may have been many!</p>

		<br>
		<p>The first edition of scouting for boys was published in 1908. Our book doesn't date quite that far back but is a sixteenth-edition book published in 1932. </p>
